THE JAR WAS RETURNED IN A LARGE BIOHAZARD BAG. THE LENS WAS REMOVED AND ALLOWED TO AIR DRY PRIOR TO EVALUATION. THE PORTION OF LENS THAT WAS RETURNED CONTAINED THE ONE HAPTIC AREA. THIS HAPTIC WAS BROKEN IN THE DISTAL AREA. THE BROKEN PORTION OF HAPTIC WAS NOT RETURNED. THE OPTIC WAS CUT FROM THE EDGE, THROUGH THE CENTER, TO THE OPPOSITE EDGE SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE TO DAMAGE CREATED WHEN REMOVING A LENS FROM THE EYE.
