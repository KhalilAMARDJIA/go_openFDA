THE PLUNGER LOCK AND LENS STOP WERE REMOVED. THE PLUNGER WAS ORIENTED CORRECTLY. VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. THE PLUNGER WAS FULLY ADVANCED TO THE TIP AND HAS UNDER-RODE THE LENS. HALF OF THE OPTIC HAS EXTENDED OUTSIDE THE DEVICE TIP. THE LEADING HAPTIC WAS TORN AWAY FROM THE OPTIC AND INCLUDED OPTIC MATERIAL. THE BROKEN DISTAL AREA WAS RETURNED ADHERED IN SOLUTION TO THE OPTIC. THE TRAILING HAPTIC WAS POSITIONED ON TOP OF THE PLUNGER, MISFOLDED UNDERNEATH THE OPTIC IN THE TIP OF THE DEVICE.

THE LENS WAS TORN INTO PIECES AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC WAS MISFOLDED, LOOPED AROUND THE PLUNGER TIP. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. PLUNGER UNDERRIDE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENT FASTER THAN THE INSTRUCTION FOR USE (IFU) RECOMMEND RATE. DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE, THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO UNDERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE DEVICE IS OVERFILLED WITH OVD, THIS CAN PREVENT THE TRAILING HAPTIC FROM BEING PLACED PROPERLY OR MOVE THE LENS OUT OF POSITION RESULTING IN MISFOLDING. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT.

COMPLAINT HISTORY AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORD COULD NOT BE REVIEWED BECAUSE THE REPORTING FACILITY DID NOT PROVIDE A VALID LOT NUMBER OR ANY IDENTIFICATION TRACEABLE TO THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. PHOTO 1 & 2 SHOW A THREAD LIKE PIECE OF FOREIGN MATERIAL ON A MONITOR SCREEN. PHOTO 3 SHOWS AN IOL ON A MONITOR SCREEN WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE A THREAD LIKE FOREIGN MATERIAL ON THE CENTRE OF THE OPTIC. THERE IS ALSO A WHITE SQUARE SHAPED OBJECT ON THE OPTIC BUT THIS COULD ALSO BE REFLECTION OF LIGHT. PHOTOS 4 SHOWS AN IMPLANTED IOL ON A MONITOR SCREEN WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE A THREAD LIKE FOREIGN MATERIAL ON THE CENTRE OF THE OPTIC, THERE ALSO APPEARS TO BE SCRATCHES ON THE OPTIC SURFACE. THE COMPLAINANT INDICATES THE USE OF NON-COMPANY A VISCOELASTIC, WHICH IS NOT QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH ASSOCIATED IOL MODEL. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).|A PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT DURING IMPLANTATION OF AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) A FOREIGN MATERIAL WAS FOUND ON THE BACK OF OPTIC IMMEDIATELY AFTER IMPLANTATION. A PART OF IT WAS REMOVED BY IRRIGATION/ASPIRATION(IA), BUT IT COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY REMOVED. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED WITH THE SAME LENS. ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE SURGERY PHYSICIAN CHECKED A PHOTO, A CIRCULAR SCRATCH SIMILAR TO A TORIC MARK WAS FOUND NEAR THE FOREIGN MATERIAL AND IT WAS FOUND THAT A FOREIGN MATERIAL THAT SEEMED TO BE SCRAPED FROM THE SCRATCHED PART REMAINED. THERE WAS NO EFFECT ON THE PATIENT'S VISUAL ACUITY AND THERE WAS NO POSTOPERATIVE INFLAMMATION AT THE MOMENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED AND RECEIVED STATING 1MM WHITE TRANSPARENT FIBROUS FOREIGN MATERIAL ON THE BACK OF THE IOL, SLIGHTLY BELOW THE CENTER. DURING SURGERY, IMMEDIATELY AFTER IOL INSERTION, TWO PALE FOREIGN MATERIALS WERE STUCK TO THE BACK OF THE LENS ALONG WITH A 1MM-SIZED SCRATCH WE TRIED TO ASPIRATE IT OUT WITH IA, AND PART OF IT WAS REMOVED, BUT IT COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY REMOVED. CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF LENS CORTEX RESIDUE, THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENT. AS OF THE 11TH DAY AFTER THE SURGERY, THE MATERIAL REMAINED UNABSORBED. THE PHYSICIAN CONSIDERS THAT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IS EITHER A SCRATCH OR A FOREIGN MATERIAL (LENS MATERIAL) CREATED DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF THE IOL OR DURING THE SETTING OF THE IOL (FOR SOME REASON SUCH AS PROTRUSIONS IN THE CARTRIDGE OR CAUSED BY THE SURGEON'S HANDLING).

THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT ''CRACK WAS FOUND IN IOL OPTIC"". THE PRODUCT AND IMPLANTATION ACCESSORIES SUCH AS CARTRIDGE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. VIDEO EVALUATION CONFIRMED MARK ON THE OPTIC EDGE. THE ROOT CAUSE MAY BE RELATED TO FAILURE TO FOLLOW IFU (INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE), AS THE CUSTOMER STATES THE USE OF NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD (OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICES) MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. LENS DELIVERY PERFORMANCE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WHEN USING OTHER NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTICS LEADING TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING , DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND / OR PRODUCT DAMAGE. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. IN ADDITION TO THIS, ALL IOLS ARE 100% COSMETICALLY INSPECTED AS PER APPROVED MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES AND THE OBSERVED LENS DAMAGE WOULD NOT MEET OUR CURRENT RELEASE CRITERIA. BASED ON THESE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS, WE ARE UNABLE TO VERIFY IF THE IOL/DEVICE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. ALL PRODUCT AND BATCH HISTORY RECORDS ARE QUALITY REVIEWED PRIOR TO PRODUCT RELEASE.

PLUNGER OVERRIDE MAY OCCUR: IF THE LENS HAS BECOME MISALIGNED IN THE LENS BAY DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO OVERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT.
